# Myagi Web Frontend

This folder contains the React app which powers our web frontend.

## Getting started

Make sure you have the latest version of `node` and `yarn`, then run `yarn install` followed
by `yarn start`.

## Syncing shared repos

We use git subrepos to share code between our web frontend and our native apps repo (myagi-mobile-apps).
