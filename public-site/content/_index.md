howItWorks1:
  heading: Plug in to the Myagi Network
  text: Myagi enables brands and retailers to connect to one another with a single
    click. Brands upload product training material and create lessons. Retailers choose
    the brands they carry and select what information to deliver to their frontline
    staff, including Myagi's own renowned retail skills training.
howItWorks2:
  heading: Turn personalized learning into positive customer experiences
  text: Retail staff start the day off right when they open the Myagi app and learn
    about the day's lessons right there on their mobile devices. Hand pick which content
    you want them to digest, and give different teams different learning content.
howItWorks3:
  heading: Tap into Myagi's retail knowledge library, or add your own training content
  text: Besides brand knowledge, boost a team's retail skills with exclusive classes
    from leading retail experts. Retailers can also upload videos, documents, and
    quizzes straight into Myagi and build private learning plans and lessons for their
    own team.
howItWorks4:
  heading: Track learning progress and gain training insights
  text: Measurement precedes improvement. Myagi gives feedback to pinpoint where best
    to focus to continually improve the performance of your team every day. You can
    even gamify learning with leaderboards and reward programs.
howItWorks5:
  heading: Communicate with your team / brands / retailers within minutes
  text: Emailing to-and-fro with brands means vital messages can get lost in their
    daily inbox barrage. In some cases, failing to update how they sell a product
    can ruin the sell-thru. Myagi gives you a channel to communicate with them, without
    messages getting lost in the noise.
featuresHeading: Tailor-fit features for retail
feature1:
  heading: Access our massive network of brands
  text: Our training content library is stocked full of the material from hundreds
    of brands and experts. As a retailer, you can connect to the brands you stock.
    As a brand, you can add your own material to this library within minutes.  Trust
    us, we timed it.
feature2:
  heading: Super simple content creation
  text: Myagi's content creation tools are powerful yet easy to use. Create lessons
    using videos, documents, quizzes, websites, SCORM content, and flashcards. When
    you're ready you can share that content with your team or with the entire Myagi
    network.
feature3:
  heading: Communicate and coordinate
  text: Sometimes you just need to get a quick message out to frontline staff. With
    Myagi, you can deliver announcements which then become discussion threads. Keep
    control of the messages by only allowing admins and managers to post, lest that
    cheeky employee send out a poop emoji en masse.
feature4:
  heading: 'BYOB: Bring your own branding'
  text: Your team deserves to feel at home, so own your space with Myagi’s rich custom
    branding features. Make your own landing and sign-in pages, customize the content
    you share, and so much more.
feature5:
  heading: Reward and incentivize learning
  text: Myagi makes it easy to reward staff for performing well—even if you're a brand.
    Attach badges to sequences of learning content; you can even include discounts
    or free products with those badges.
feature6:
  heading: Simple setup and 24/7 support
  text: Signing up is a breeze, and once you're in our 24/7 live support team will
    be available to help you and your staff with any issues you may run into while
    using Myagi. Or, you know, if you just wanna chat.
